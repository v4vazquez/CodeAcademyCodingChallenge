//1. Print all even numbers from 0 â€“ 10
//        Try to make the solution to this problem as efficiently as possible.
//        Consider using loops that would allow you to type the fewest characters/commands.
//        While you could simply print the even numbers, get creative and see how you could output them in a way that
//        would work up to 10 or even up to 10,000 with little extra effort.
