//    This challenge is particularly helpful if you’re planning to become a Data Scientist. Manipulating data is a significant part of the role,
//    and building the foundations now will help you later down the road when you’re working with large databases.
//    Start small here and work your way up. Begin with an array of 5 numbers, and then try your program with a larger array to verify its success.
public class ArrayReversal {

//    public int[] reverseArray(){
//        int reverseArray[] = {37,9,-65,22,91};
//        int newArray[] = {reverseArray.length};
//        for (int i = 0; i < reverseArray.length; i++) {
//            newArray= reverseArray[i];
//        }
